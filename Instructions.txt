Steps followed:
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models # cloning git repo for tf models

pip3 install Cython contextlib2 pillow lxml jupyter matplotlib # installing dependencies

git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git # large dataset for object detection
# Please Note : cocoapi could not be added to github. However, it could be downloaded using the intructions.

cd cocoapi/PythonAPI # changing directory

Now Change in Makefile ...alter python to python3

make # build project

cd ../../

cp -r cocoapi/PythonAPI/pycocotools models/research/  
# copying recently build pycocotools to tf directory

#download protobuf
wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.11.2/protoc-3.11.2-linux-x86_64.zip

# unzip protoc zip file
unzip protoc-3.11.2-linux-x86_64.zip
cp bin/protoc models/research
cd models/research

pip3 install opencv-python

#created a proto_to_py.py file and add following script. This .py must be place inside /models/research 
# execute using python3 proto_to_py.py

import os
import sys
directory = 'object_detection/protos'
protoc_path = './protoc'
for file in os.listdir(directory):
    if file.endswith(".proto"):
        os.system(protoc_path+" "+directory+"/"+file+" --python_out=.")



ls object_detection/protos/ 
# just to view

python3 setup.py build  
# model building

sudo python3 setup.py install 
# installing tf module

"""
In case tensorflow module is not detected, try following:
#working_dir = os.getcwd()
#path = working_dir + ':' + working_dir + '/slim'
#os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = path

OR

When running locally, the tensorflow/models/research/ and slim directories should be appended to PYTHONPATH. This can be done by running the following from tensorflow/models/research/:

# From tensorflow/models/research/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim

Note: This command needs to run from every new terminal you start. If you wish to avoid running this manually, you can add it as a new line to the end of your ~/.bashrc file, replacing `pwd` with the absolute path of tensorflow/models/research on your system.

# Initially, I had used pip3 install tensorflow to link tensorflow. However, to avoid last minute changes I preferred not be experiment with environment variables, 
# but I feel setting environment variables could be useful.

"""

video_extractor.py must be present at /models/research/object_detection/

Final command to execute:

python3 video_extractor.py <full path to video file>
